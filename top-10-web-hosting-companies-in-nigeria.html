You are in the right website. And just in time to digest this information.</p><p>There are many factors that we need to put into consideration if we are truly going to determine the top 10 web hosting companies in Nigeria.</p><p>Let me briefly state some of these factors.</p><li>Up-time</li><li>Disk space</li><li>Bandwidth</li><li>Reputation</li><li>Prices offered.</li><p>You want a place where they keep their word. Trust me, some web host will give you problems, take down your website or blog and even ask you to pay for more.</p><p>When I began going on the internet, I needed to get a website done. After learning some things about WordPress and how to install a website on a web host, I decided to try a site of mine. I never knew much but I did a little research and found a good web host. I saw the many plans they have as Nigerian host. Then I never had a master card. I quickly proceeded and purchased the lowest plan for 2500 naira.</p><p>The site was good and I never knew how to monitor anything. It was after 7 months that I decided to allow the site to expire. The point I was making was that I enjoyed the web host though I wanted more.</p><p>After that initial experience, I found another web hosting company in Nigeria which is listed among the top ten. This time around, they were ok but I paid more. I also had issues which were not resolved on time.</p><p>I quickly started planning to move to another web hosting company in Nigeria.</p><p>Some of the lessons learned will I share with you. So here are my suggestions. The top hosting companies listed are all good depending on what you really want as some hosting companies offer better services or have strong points on some of their plans like vps, dedicated hosting, shared hosting or <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Cloud Storage Provider"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":2,"4":[null,2,11982760]}'>Cloud Storage Provider</span>.</p><p>Remember that our experiences may be different and that is in no particular order. As far as Nigerians are concerned, these ones have been chosen. Some are also based on reviews from customers that have used their services.</p><p>This list is not written in any particular order.
