He then signed with the Saints, where he served as backup to <a href=# rel=noopener>Drew Brees</a> for four seasons. That included a Super Bowl victory during the 2009 season, although Daniel didn't see a single minute of action on the field that year. In the following three seasons, Daniel threw only nine passes and rushed eight times (including kneel-downs), primarily serving as the team's placeholder on kicks.</p><p>He didn't see his first start until the fifth season of his career, his first year with Kansas City. The Chiefs had locked in their playoff seed by Week 17, so Daniel got the starting nod. He spent two more years in Kansas City (starting one more game) before bouncing to Philadelphia and back to New Orleans, spending one season each with the Eagles and Saints.</p><p>In 2018, Daniel landed in Chicago, and that's where he saw his most NFL quarterbacking action. In two seasons with the Bears, Daniel played eight games, starting in three of them. He amassed 950 yards with six touchdowns and four interceptions. Daniel then joined the Lions for a season before landing on the Chargers, serving as the backup to <a href=# title="Justin Herbert Net Worth">Justin Herbert</a>. He re-signed this offseason with a one-year, $2.25 million contract. That will bring his total career earnings above $42 million, which puts him at 62nd on the all-time earnings list for quarterbacks.</p><p>For his career, Daniel has complete 178 of 261 passes (68.2 percent) for 1,690 yards, eight touchdowns, and seven interceptions. He's also rushed 54 times for 116 yards. Those are hardly Hall of Fame numbers, but they've been serviceable enough to give Daniel a long career.</p><p>In total, Daniel has appeared in 70 games over 13 years — and even that number is a bit inflated since many of his appearances on the Saints came as a placeholder, not the quarterback. Still, he's made an impressive $553,571 per appearance thus far. And assuming he doesn't make another start this season, he'll have earned more than $8 million for every game he's started in the NFL by the time 2023 rolls around. Not bad for a player who went undrafted!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpyfmquVYrGiusieo2agkah6rq3DnmSaZaOpwrG1w2aYpqelo8Fuu8VmpKimla56tLXTraCnn12ku27Ax55krKGUmrmqusSsZJqrXZZ6pK3RnpyrZZKWsKzBz2aorpmiqbKzrsCcomg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-lemons-snapchat.html><span>←</span><span>What is Sean Lemon's Snapchat?</span></a>
