A married mother of nine named Laura Ann Carleton was shot and killed in the parking lot of her Cedar Glen, California, clothing store. Know all details about the shooting and the suspect behind it.</p><h2>Who is Travis Ikeguchi?</h2><p><strong>After shooting and killing a California woman, sheriff’s investigators say the 27-year-old suspect tore down a Pride flag outside the store and yelled homophobic comments.</strong> Travis Ikeguchi opened fire on 66-year-old Laura “Lauri” Carleton as she stood in front of her Cedar Glen store, Mag.Pi. Ikeguchi was positively identified as the shooter on Monday.</p><p>A Pride or rainbow banner was flying in front of the Mag.Pi store, and Ikeguchi tore it down and hurled many homophobic comments about Carleton, San Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus told reporters on Monday. Apparently, Carleton shot Ikeguchi after confronting her, as reported by the sheriff. Her death was officially confirmed there.</p><p><strong>According to Dicus, Ikeguchi opened fire on deputies about a mile from the store, damaging several patrol cars.</strong> Ikeguchi was shot by responding deputies, resulting in his death at the spot, Dicus reported. Deputy sheriffs were unharmed. According to Dicus, other eyewitnesses confirmed that Ikeguchi had shot Carleton and chased after him as he ran from the business. Officials claim that Ikeguchi did not have a license to carry a concealed weapon and that the pistol he used was not registered to him.</p><p><strong>Take a look at below tweet:</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Police have just identified the man who shot and killed a woman for flying a Pride flag outside her business as Travis Ikeguchi.</p><p>Here is a tweet from June.</p><p>MAGA hatred kills. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/k79fxAnf6y</a></p><p>— No Lie with Brian Tyler Cohen (@NoLieWithBTC) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 22, 2023</a></p><p>The murder of Carleton was still being looked into. NBC News reports that police are looking into the incident as a possible hate crime. As is customary after police shootings or other deadly interactions, the district attorney’s office will look into this shooting. The suspect “was positively identified by his next of kin as the suspect in this case,” Rodriguez added.
