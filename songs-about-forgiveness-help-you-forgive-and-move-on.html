Wings oF Forgiveness, India Arie</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album: </strong>Testimony: Vol. 1, Life & Relationship<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Year of Release: </strong>2006</li></ul><p>“You’re only human, Let’s shake free this gravity of resentment, And fly high, and fly high, You’re only human, Let’s shake free this gravity of judgment, And fly high on the wings of forgiveness”</p><p>This is just one among many songs that talk about the kind of pain people cause one another. Here India Arie serves everyone a quick reminder that we are mere mortals and we are bound to err.</p><p>The song discourages people from making judgments based on wrongs done, rather it should be replaced by love.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=2_I_Forgive_You_Kellie_Pickler></span><strong>2. I Forgive You, Kellie Pickler</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>The Woman I Am</li><li><strong>Year of Release: </strong>2013</li></ul><p>“This hurt is drowning me inside, It’s like an ocean deep and wide, And you were an anchor pulling me down, Pulling me down”</p><p>Resentment and anger only drag one down to the bottom of the pit. Here is Kellie Pickler saying it is pointless reacting based on anger because it will hurt the more. Instead, respond with love because unforgiveness is a heavy burden.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=3_Hello_Adele></span><strong>3. Hello, Adele</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>25</li><li><strong>Year of Release: </strong>2015</li></ul><p>“Hello from the other side, I must’ve called a thousand times, To tell you I’m sorry, for everything that I’ve done, But when I call, you never seem to be home”</p><p>Here is another song about forgiveness from Adele. She dishes out an apology which came a little bit late, having missed a couple of opportunities to reconcile.</p><p>Not many people can swallow their pride and shit their ego out to admit the wrong things they have done. It becomes even more difficult when the aggrieved person rejects the offer. But, never forget that forgiveness is the only to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">peace of mind</a>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=4_In_Between_Linkin_Park></span><strong>4. In Between, Linkin Park</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>Minutes to Midnight</li><li><strong>Year of Release:&nbsp;</strong>2007</li></ul><p>“Let me apologize to begin with, Let me apologize for what I’m about to say, But trying to be genuine was harder than it seemed, And somehow I got caught up in between”</p><p>This is a song about forgiveness where Linkin Park started the song by apologizing in advance. He talked about how it is difficult to real. Whenever you apologize, it doesn’t reduce you in the eye of the people, rather it means that you are humble enough to accept that you are wrong.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=5_Purple_Rain_Prince></span><strong>5. Purple Rain, Prince</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>Purple Rain</li><li><strong>Year of Release:&nbsp;</strong>1984</li></ul><p>” I never meant to cause you any sorrow, I never meant to cause you any pain, I only wanted to one time to see you laughing”</p><p>Prince didn’t only apologize but also pray for things to get better. The word sorry is the key to healing. However, the cycle can only be complete there is forgiveness.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=6_Forgiveness_TobyMac_Ft_Lecrae></span><strong>6. Forgiveness, TobyMac Ft. Lecrae</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>Eye On It (2012)</li><li><strong>Year of Release:&nbsp;</strong>2012</li></ul><p>“‘Cause we all make mistakes sometimes, And we all step across the line, But nothing’s sweeter than the day we find”</p><p>Here is another song about forgiveness that takes a different route. There are instances where people walk around with guilts in their chests because they is were refused forgiveness. Truth be told, we all stumble and fall at some point in our lives, and may demand forgiveness from those we wronged. So, it is ideal we forgive so that others can forgive us for our wrongs too.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=7_Last_Time_I_Say_Sorry_John_Legend_and_Kayne_Brown></span><strong>7. Last Time I Say Sorry, John Legend and Kayne Brown</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>Last Time I Say Sorry</li><li><strong>Year of Release:&nbsp;</strong>2021</li></ul><p>“I won’t say I’m sorry over and over, Can’t just say I’m sorry, I’ve gotta show you, I won’t do it again, I’ll prove my love is true, I hope the last time I said sorry, Is the last time I’ll say sorry to you”</p><p>An apology is useless when the wrong is repeated many times over. A real ‘sorry’ means “I won’t ever repeat it again”.</p><p>Most times people take the word sorry for granted and are never ready to change that bad attitude. These scenarios are often seen in relationships and marriages.</p><p>Here, the song is asking for second chances after terrible wrong. It says people should match their apologies with action, meaning such wrongs would never be repeated to the one hurt.</p><p><strong>Also See-&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Best Slow Dance Songs Everyone Should Listen To</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=8_I_Forgive_You_Kelly_Clarkson></span><strong>8. I Forgive You, Kelly Clarkson</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>Stronger</li><li><strong>Year of Release:&nbsp;</strong>2011</li></ul><p>“I forgive you, We were just a couple of kids, Trying to figure out how to live, Doing it our way, No shame, no blame, ‘Cause the damage is done, And I forgive you”</p><p>You’d forgive people easily when you understand where they are coming from. Holding a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grudge</a> for a long time is a burden that robs us of our inner peace. Forgive, so you have your peace.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=9_Forgiven_Me_Mary_Mary></span><strong>9. Forgiven Me, Mary Mary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>The Sound</li><li><strong>Year of Release:&nbsp;</strong>2008</li></ul><p>“I never ever wanna press rewind, never wanna go back in time, not much glory in that story, but it’s mine so I’m lovin who I am today, the past has passed away, finally I have forgiven me”</p><p>If you don’t forgive yourself, how can you forgive others? Yes, forgiving oneself is a difficult project, but for inner peace, forgive yourself. Once you do this, you have broken the power of the past over yourself.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=10_Time_Is_a_Healer_Eva_Cassidy></span><strong>10. Time Is a Healer, Eva Cassidy</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>Eva By Heart</li><li><strong>Year of Release:&nbsp;</strong>1997</li></ul><p>“I found a picture of your smiling face, Bringing old memories, That I had locked away, The burden of anger, From a heart filled with pain, Was finally lifted, And I smiled at you again”</p><p>There are instances where we want to revenge for a wrong done to us by people because of the pains we went through. And forgiveness becomes the last thing on our minds.</p><p>Interestingly, this song makes us understand that times can extinguish the flames of our anger and kills the pain. It makes us willing to offer forgiveness.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=11_So_Sorry_Feist></span><strong>11. So Sorry, Feist</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>The Reminder</li><li><strong>Year of Release:&nbsp;</strong>2007</li></ul><p>“I’m sorry, Two words I always think, After you’re gone, When I realize I was acting all wrong”<br>Many times when the word sorry is said on time, it can mend broken a broken heart, and even save a relationship. Feist reminds us that it is okay to say almost immediately.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=12_Apology_Song_The_Decemberists></span><strong>12. Apology Song, The Decemberists</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>5 Songs</li><li><strong>Year of Release:&nbsp;</strong>2004</li></ul><p>“I’m really sorry, Steven, but your bicycle’s been stolen. I was watching it for you ’til you came back in the fall. I guess I didn’t do such a good job after all. I was feeling really sorry, Steven, and I spent all morning grieving.”</p><p>This is another song about forgiveness where the guilty apologizes to his friend for stealing his bicycle. The person who stole the bicycle was forgiven, after all, he was remorseful for his actions.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=13_Back_To_December_Taylor_Swift></span><strong>13. Back To December, Taylor Swift</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>Speak Now</li><li><strong>Year of Release:&nbsp;</strong>2010</li></ul><p>“So this is me swallowin’ my pride, Standin’ in front of you sayin’ I’m sorry for that night, And I go back to December all the time, It turns out freedom ain’t nothin’ but missin’ you, Wishin’ I’d realized what I had when you were mine”</p><p>The bitter truth is relationships have an expiry date. And when that happens, feelings of regret arise. Taylor Swift exemplifies it in this song, making an effort to reconcile with an ex-lover. But then, just make sure the apology is not too late.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=14_Pray_for_Forgiveness_Alicia_Keys></span><strong>14. Pray for Forgiveness, Alicia Keys</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>The Element of Freedom</li><li><strong>Year of Release:&nbsp;</strong>2009</li></ul><p>“Beautiful garden where have you gone, My self-delusions are leaving me in the storm, Taking for granted all the goodness that I’ve found, Somewhere I lost all, the control came crashing down”.</p><p>Alicia Keys reiterates the importance of self-forgiveness in this song. No matter what, one must look deep down because the strength to forgive oneself lies there.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=15_Forgiveness_Matthew_West></span><strong>15. Forgiveness, Matthew West</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p></p><ul><li><strong>Album:&nbsp;</strong>Into the Light</li><li><strong>Year of Release: </strong>2012</li></ul><p>“It’s the hardest thing to give away, And the last thing on your mind today, It always goes to those who don’t deserve, It’s the opposite of how you feel, When they pain they caused is just too real, Takes everything you have to say the word-Forgiveness, forgiveness”</p><p>Forgiveness has never been easy, but it is crucial in our lives. Matthew West’s song offers a spiritual angle to the importance of forgiveness.</p><p>Other songs about forgiveness include</p><ul><li>Forgive and Forget by You Me At Six</li><li>AngryAnymore by Ani Difranco</li><li>A Song for You by Amy Winehouse</li><li>Whatever It Takes by Lifehouse</li><li>For What It’s Worth</li></ul><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51kwLC6xqxkmpqfqsFuss6rnqKulaOytL%2BMoZylqF2uvLZ5xaipoKGmmnqiusNmpKiulWK8r3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-check-doors-locked-pray-23739171.html><span>←</span><span>Newham stabbing: Terrified residents 'lock doors and pray to God' after man stabbed to death when su</span></a>
