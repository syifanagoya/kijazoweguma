The reality TV clan has teamed up with firearm company Mossberg to release nine shotguns, two semiautomatic rifles, and a semiautomatic pistol — a collection they're calling the "Duck Commander" series.</p><p>All 12 firearms feature "waterfowl pattern" camouflage design and bear the Duck Commander logo, the company said. And according to <a href=#>CNN</a>, each comes with an American flag bandana "like the one worn by Willie [Robertson]" on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>"Mossberg is extremely proud to partner with Duck Commander to further promote hunting, shooting sports, and family values," CEO Iver Mossberg said in a release about the deal. "The Robertsons' widespread appeal and ability to cross over into the mainstream has bridged millions to the traditions of hunting and sharing time in the field with family."</p><p>Added Willie Robertson: "The Duck Commander franchise was built on hard work, family values, and our great American heritage. As an iconic, hard-working American product, made by a family-owned company, Mossberg is a perfect partnership for our team."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The launch of the new gun line comes on the heels of controversy for the Robertsons. In December, Duck Dynasty patriarch <strong>Phil Robertson</strong> was suspended from the A&E show for making some racially charged remarks in an interview with GQ. However, after his family said they wouldn't do the show without him, the network backed down and welcomed Phil back into the fold.</p><p>"Duck Dynasty is not a show about one man's views. It resonates with a large audience because it is a show about family…a family that America has come to love," A&E said in a statement on Dec. 27. "As you might have seen in many episodes, they come together to reflect and pray for unity, tolerance, and forgiveness. These are three values that we at A&E Networks also feel strongly about."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadrZOgeqXFzZqqrbGjYr%2BwrsSrq6ynnmKzornIpbBmpJGqu6S0xKxkpaGemnqwsoygrKerXWd9coCSamY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashley-leisinger-entrepreneur-wiki-biography-age-height-weight-husband-net-worth-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ashley Leisinger (Entrepreneur) Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Net Worth</span></a>
