According to Javier Gaytán Moran, head of the geology department at the Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur, “the famed arch of Cabo San Lucas could collapse at any time owing to natural causes, due to a fracture in the structure of the rock produced by nature” (UABCS)."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
