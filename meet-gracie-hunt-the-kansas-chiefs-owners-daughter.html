Thus, she belongs to the Caucasian ethnic group of the country. Gracie is from a wealthy family and has some well-known relatives. Her paternal grandpa Lamar Hunt was a Pro Football Hall of Famer.

This was in 2018.</p><p>Building on the popularity that came with the pageantries she won, Gracie Hunt launched her career as a social media influencer. She now commands thousands of followers on Instagram and Twitter. Growing up, she played soccer and probably wanted to play at a professional level. She gave up the dream after suffering a series of concussions and is now focused on being a model and a social media influencer.</p><p>In addition to that, she is a blogger.
