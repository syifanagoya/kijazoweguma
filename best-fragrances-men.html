There are so many different styles of fragrance, some more woody, others more floral, and others yet smelling aromatic and spicy.</p><p>Within each of these groups is a huge number of different individual fragrances, so how do you find the right fragrance for you?</p><p>The best bet is to start with only three or four fragrances. Consider how they make you feel, and what you imagine you might be doing while wearing one versus the other.</p><p>Fresh scents like lemon and iris may be more suited to summer days, while woody and spicy scents like sandalwood or cedar may feel more appropriate for winter evenings.</p><p>That said, what sort of fragrance you wear and when you wear it is entirely up to you. There’s fun to be had in wearing a fragrance that may feel out of place at first, throwing a curveball, so to speak.</p><p>In between smelling your potential fragrances, be sure to take a whiff of coffee beans to help clear your scent palate. Most fragrance shops will have a pot of coffee beans or similar to serve this purpose.</p><h3>What fragrances last the longest?</h3><p>How long a fragrance lasts can vary from person to person, but it also depends on what you’re doing, how much you apply, and what you do after application.</p><p>Fragrances are best applied before any other skincare products are used. Moisturizers can create a barrier between the fragrance and your skin, affecting how long it lasts, but also changing how the fragrance smells.</p><p>Fragrances react with the oils on your skin, and because people have different types and quantities of oils, the resulting smell may be considerably different when worn by different people.</p><p>Some good long-lasting fragrances you may consider include Alien by Mugler, Bloom by Gucci, and Black Orchid by Tom Ford. Be sure to test out these fragrances on your skin to see how they smell on you.</p><h3>Is it a good idea to wear two fragrances at once?</h3><p>Combining, or “layering”, different fragrances can be a great way to come up with your own signature scent.</p><p>When choosing what fragrances to layer, consider their general scent profile. Are they more along the woody lines? Or do they present citrus, floral, or spicy scents?</p><p>Many report the best results come from combining fragrances that are significantly different from one another.
