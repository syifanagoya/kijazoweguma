His sisters rose to fame as a musical duo, Chloe x Halle. They performed song covers on their YouTube channel. However, their lives changed after they did a cover of Beyoncé’s song “Pretty Hurts.” Almost ten years later, they have a record deal with Parkwood Entertainment.</p><p>In addition, they released two studio albums, received Grammy nominations, and secured leading movie roles. However, the former musical duo has decided to go solo, with the sisters releasing their music and albums. Due to his sisters’ fame, Branson started to gain public attention, as he had been by their side for the whole journey.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about the celebrity sibling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-23_05-18-16-fotor-2023082352047.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Branson_Bailey></span>How Old Is Branson Bailey?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chloe and Halle’s brother, Branson Bailey, was born in Mableton, Georgia, United States, on October 3, 2005.

However, he grew up in Mableton with his parents, Courtney and Doug Bailey.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, he is the couple’s only son and the only brother of the famous sisters. While details about his elementary education remain undisclosed, online reports suggest Branson is currently in high school. Despite his sister’s fame, the celebrity sibling shies away from social media and appears alongside his famous sisters at events.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Chloe_and_Halles_Brother_Into_Entertainment></span>Is Chloe and Halle’s Brother Into Entertainment?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, he isn’t. However, according to his sisters, Branson Bailey sometimes joins in on their musical sessions to record music. Aside from this, he enjoys basketball and track.

According to Chloe, her favorite moments include watching Halle drag Branson into joining their skincare rituals and facials.</p><p>Although he is the youngest of his siblings, Chloe and Halle often have deep conversations with Branson. While preparing him for the real world, his sisters uplift him at every chance; they remind him that he is perfect and has beautiful skin. In addition, they also advise him not to let people’s opinions of him determine how he views himself.&nbsp;</p><p>While Branson Bailey has yet to decide on a career path, he has gained the attention of his famous sister’s fans. Hence, many are eager to see what the future holds for the Bailey sisters’ brother.</p><p>Like Branson Bailey, Nicki Minaj’s brother, <a href=#>Micaiah Maraj</a>, also lives a low-profile life away from the media.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kr7Otzaymp2WSlratsdhmpJ6dpGKwqbjOnmSappRitaK4y55km5mZobK6v4ybqaismJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-does-my-kohler-toilet-whistle-html.html><span>←</span><span>Why Does My Kohler toilet whistle?</span></a>
