The hotel was designed by architect Albert Martin and was originally intended to be an apartment building. However, it was later converted into a hotel due to the rise in demand for luxury accommodations in the area.</p><p>Over the years, the hotel has hosted many notable events, including the Golden Globe Awards and the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Beverly Hills International Film Festival</a>.</p><h3>The Sister Hotel</h3><p>The Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel has a sister hotel in Tokyo, Japan, called the Regent Tokyo. Both hotels are part of the Regent Hotels & Resorts chain.</p><h3>Filming Locations at the Regent Beverly Wilshire</h3><p><strong>The Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel served as the primary filming location for the iconic movie Pretty Woman</strong>. The hotel’s exterior, lobby, and rooms were all used in the film. The famous scene where Julia Roberts’ character Vivian is asked if she is “here for the weekend?” was filmed in the hotel’s lobby.</p><p>The hotel’s presidential suite was also used in the film.
