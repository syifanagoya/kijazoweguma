"I went to 60th Street and Cedar Block. [I'm] bringing both worlds together and trying to uplift the poverty side of the community and show them where I'm from. I'm from Virginia, but everybody comes from a broken home or being broke — I remember when I was."</p><p>According to <a href=#>Complex magazine</a>, the shoot involved about 20 extras dressed in baggy jeans and shorts in typical '90s West Coast wear, at times bopping to the beat on the sidewalk and at times appearing on a rooftop in South Central.</p><p>Last August, <a href=#>Billboard confirmed</a> that a posthumous Aaliyah album was in the works, set for a release by the end of 2012. Drake, along with Aaliyah's mentors Timbaland and <strong>Missy Elliott</strong>, were to help spearhead the project.</p><p>The late "Are You That Somebody" singer's family took to Facebook shortly after rumors of the album began circulating, however, denying their support for the album.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"There is no official album being released and supported by the Haughton family," her brother <strong>Rashad Haughton</strong> wrote on Aaliyah's official Facebook page.</p><p>The "One in a Million" singer died tragically at age 22 on Aug. 25, 2001 after a plane transporting her and her team from the Bahamas back to the States crashed shortly after takeoff. The 90s R&B icon has been memorialized in numerous ways ever since, including <a href=#>as a back tattoo</a> just below Drake's left shoulder blade.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhqpmoeqO%2BzrClZqyfYsCiuc%2BlnGaqkaeybq3ApaCymZhiw7CvwKWqZqGeYrumw4yspqefXam1psWMnaanrF2gu7DDjGtnamthaYJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-look-at-olivia-munns-dating-history-2.html><span>←</span><span>A Look At Olivia Munns Dating History</span></a>
