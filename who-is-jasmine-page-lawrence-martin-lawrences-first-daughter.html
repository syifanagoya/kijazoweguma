Her nationality is American, while her ethnicity is African-American. Lawrence is the first child of ace actor, comedian, and producer Martin Lawrence.</p><p>Martin started as a comedian in places such as Washington D.C. and New York before landing on various TV shows and movies in the 90s. He later made a breakthrough after scoring his TV series, Martin. Martin debuted on Fox in 1994 and featured the comic as a selfish, free-spirited, smart-mouth radio DJ who can be relied upon to come through for his loved ones in their time of need.</p><p>The show attracted millions of viewers and helped make Fox one of the top television networks in America. Since that breakout role, Martin Lawrence has appeared in several blockbuster movies, usually of a comic persuasion. They include House Party, Do the Right Thing, Big Momma’s House, A Thin Line Between Love and Hate, and Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins.</p><p>He is also the star of the multimillion-dollar film franchise known as Bad Boys. Bad Boys features him and Will Smith in the lead roles of two partner cops who are often tasked with tackling one major criminal element or the other. There have been three Bad Boy movies so far, and they have grossed a total of nearly a billion dollars.</p><h2><strong>Her Mother, </strong><strong>Patricia Smith,&nbsp;</strong><strong>is a Former Beauty Queen, Philanthropist, and Public Speaker</strong></h2><p>Jasmine Lawrence’s mother is a former beauty queen named Patricia Smith (nee Southall). Smith is a native of Virginia and holds a degree in journalism from James Madison University. She won the Miss Virginia USA crown in 1993 and made history as the first African American to achieve that feat.</p><p>She subsequently represented her state at the national levels, Miss USA 1994, and finished as the first runner-up. Since then, Patricia Smith has been involved with several charity initiatives.</p><p>One of her pet projects is Treasure You. Treasure You is aimed at supporting and inspiring women in productive sectors. Smith was motivated to start the organization due to her own experience. She didn’t just want to be the spouse of a famous man and sought to help other women in similar situations.</p><p>Smith has chronicled her experiences in a book titled Second Chances: Finding Healing for Your Pain, Regaining Your Strength, Celebrating Your New Life. This is with a view to helping others who are similarly looking to find their purpose in life.</p><h2><strong>Jasmine Page Lawrence’s Parents Began Dating in 1992 and Wed in 1995</strong></h2><p>Martin Lawrence and Patricia Smith first met each other in Virginia in the summer of 1992. Smith was a media aide for the state governor while Lawrence came to perform at the Def Jam Comedy Concert.</p><p>He was already a rising actor/comic at that time, and they took a shine to each other. They subsequently started dating. The couple’s relationship lasted for about three years, during which Lawrence grew even wealthier and famous.</p><p>His love for Patricia also blossomed, and they got engaged. The couple was truly in blissful love, but some of the people in Martin Lawrence’s camp were not happy. They painted Patricia as a gold-digger who wanted to milk him for his contacts and money.</p><p>The couple at the eye of this storm did not pay any heed to their detractors and tied the knot on 7th January 1995. The wedding took place at the Norfolk Waterside Marriott Hotel and attracted 600 guests and about <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>500 gawkers</a>.</p><h3><strong>They Divorced in 1997 after 20 Months Together</strong></h3><p>Patricia Smith and Martin Lawrence welcomed Jasmine a year after their nuptials. They were initially overjoyed over her birth and enjoyed some months as a loving family unit. Things, however, started to unravel around July 1996 when Martin began exhibiting increasingly erratic behavior.</p><p>He dangerously swerved off a road when Patricia was with him in his car in July 1996. By September of that same year, he picked a fight with her in the middle of the night and shoved her quite hard. Patricia initially stomached these things, but she later started fearing her and Jasmine’s safety. She, therefore, checked into a hotel with her baby, but this did not mark the end of her torment.</p><p>Martin allegedly continued making all sorts of threats against her. He threatened to kill her and her entire family. Displaying the classic signs of an obsessed lover, he allegedly declared that he loves her to death, and if he couldn’t have her, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>no one will. </a>Patricia refused to head back home despite all these threats, and her husband eventually filed for divorce in 1997.</p><p>The divorce process took a short time to complete, but it was nevertheless complicated. Patricia contested the prenup she had signed and asked for generous spousal support. She also asked for child support and custody of Jasmine. Martin contested these things, but in the end, the divorce was finalized.</p><h2><strong>Jasmine Page Lawrence Split Her Time Between Both Parents While Growing Up</strong></h2><p>Given that Jasmine Lawrence was quite tender when her parents divorced, primary custody was given to her mom, with her dad getting visitations rights. This meant that her parents sometimes had to meet face to face, and such meetings were initially awkward given how their marriage fell apart. However, with the passage of time, they decided to put their daughter’s interest first and co-parent amicably. Martin Lawrence maintained a steady presence in Jasmine’s life, and she spent more time with him as she grew older.</p><p>Jasmine Page Lawrence thus had a lot of love while growing up. Of course, she lacked for nothing materially. Her father will go on to become one of the biggest movie stars in the world, and so, she lived a life of luxury. She took vacations to the fanciest of destinations. She also attended elite private schools. Jasmine also became an integral part of her father’s world. She sometimes accompanied him to movie premieres and even got to befriend fellow celebrity kids such as Trey Smith, the oldest child of her father’s bad boy co-star, Will Smith.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/Jasmine-Page-Lawrence-1.jpg><h2><strong>She Remains Close To Both Parents To Date</strong></h2><p>Jasmine Lawrence’s parents will subsequently marry other people down the line and build new families, but they made sure to lavish enough love on their daughter. Their respective spouses also doted on her. As such, Jasmine remains quite close to both parents and has gained new parental figures in the process. She is also very close to her half-siblings. For instance, when she was inducted into a prestigious sorority in college, her mom, dad, and stepfather were there to witness it and take pictures together.</p><p>Also, on her 25th birthday in 2020, her dad paid her tribute on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a> and stated that he was proud of the woman he was becoming. In a similar vein, on the occasion of Jasmine’s 26th birthday in 2021, her mother stated that she was proud of her and prayed for more blessings for her. Jasmine was quite happy with this and declared her love for her mom in the comment section.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/01/Jasmine-Page-Lawrence.jpg><h2><strong>Jasmine Page Lawrence is One of the Stars of the Reality TV Series, Relatively Famous: Ranch Rules</strong></h2><p>Jasmine Lawrence completed her high school diploma around 2014.
