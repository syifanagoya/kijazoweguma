The live stream featured an empty, dark room late at night, and viewers were unable to comment. An intruder attempted to break a window during the stream, and moments of panic ensued.

While this has not been officially confirmed, a TikTok account potentially belonging to Inquisitor Ghost’s father released a video claiming that those responsible for his passing had orchestrated a fake story. The situation has left fans and the online community in shock and sorrow.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>🕯️Rest​ in​ peace​ Inquisitor​🕊️<br>I​ have​ to​ keep​ myself​ together​ to​ finish​ this.<br>He's such​ a​ sweet​ and​ kind​ person​<br>He's​ only​ 23, he​ didn't deserve anything like that<a href=# rel=noopener>#Inquisitore3</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#inquisitorghost</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#justiceforinquisitor</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Izf1OMvtLr</a></p><p>— Luther​Riz (@LutherRiz) <a href=# rel=noopener>October 13, 2023</a></p><p>The allegations and subsequent events have shed light on the serious issue of online accusations and the immense impact they can have on individuals’ lives, mental health, and well-being.
